# mitre_attack_sdo_csv

The script (mitre_attack_sdo_csv.py) extracts all types of SDOs (STIX Domain Objects), including STIX extensions, from the ATT&CK JSON file and converts and saves them into CSV files for each SDO type. 
You can find the resulting CSV files for the latest ATT&CK v11.3 in the "output" directory.
